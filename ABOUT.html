	 <h3> UPA - Unique Animals of the Philippines </h3>
	 <p> This page is created to spread information about the diverse ecosystem of the Philippines. By creating this page we are able to promote the country and as well as to somehow bring protection to these animals. <br> 
	  This website is merely for school purposes only, but it can also convey a message that is hopefully able to open the eyes of the media to help give it a much needed attention to hopefully help protect and <br>
      conserve these beautiful and unique creatures of the Philippines.

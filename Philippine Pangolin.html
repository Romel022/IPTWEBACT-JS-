     <p style = "font-size: 25px; margin-left: px;"> <b> Description: </b> <br> The severly endagered Philippine pangolin, or Manis culionensis, is a type of pangolin that is native only to the Philippines. The distinctive, -
scale-covered mammals known as pangolins are distinguished by their armor like appearance. The only pangolin species to be found in the Philippines is the Philippine Pangolin.
These timid, nocturnal animals devour termites and ants, and other insects. Similar to human fingers, their bodies are covered in hard, overlapping scales compromised of keratin.
They can roll into a ball when threatened to shield their delicate underside. 
These harmless creatures are critically endagered due to habitat loss, illegal poaching for their highly priced scales which are used in traditional medicine, and as well as pet trades.
To ensure the continued existence of this species, conservation efforts are being made, including protecting its habitat and taking action againts illicit wildlife trade.

     <p style = "font-size: 25px; margin-left: px;"> <b> Description: </b> <br> The Siebenrockiella leytensis, or Philippine forest turtle, is an endemic species of freshwater turtle to the Philippines that is in grave
risk of extinction. These little turtles have an oval-shaped dark carapace(shell) with a stunning pattern of radiating yellow lines. they are commonly found in lowland woods 
and watery settings and are renowned for their elusive character. 
The habitat loss, illegal collection and pet trades are the main reasons why the Philippine forest turtly is one of the rarest and most endagered turtle species in the world.
To save this species form extinction, conservation efforts such as breeding programs and habitat protection are essential. Due to its severely endagered status, it is vital to
highlight that this turtle cannot be traded internationally, and efforts are being undertaken to stop the illegal pet trades in this species.

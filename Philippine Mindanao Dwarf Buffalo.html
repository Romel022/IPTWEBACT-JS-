     <p style = "font-size: 25px; margin-left: px;">  <b> Description: </b> <br> The Bubalus mindorensis or tamaraw, also known as the Mindoro Dwarf Buffalo, is a diminutive and critically endagered breed of cattle -
that is only endigenous to the Philippine island of Mindoro. Although it shares a close relationship with the water buffalo, this species stands out due to its smaller size  
and its distinctive morphological traits. It is distinguished from other buffalo species due to its compact body, small legs, and curved horns that forms a V - shape. 
Tamaraws are mostly herbivorous animals that only eat grass and other types of flora. They are renowned for their elusive and reserved nature. 
The Mindoro Dwarf Buffalo is classified as highly endagered due to habitat degradation and hunting. Conservation efforts are being implimented to ensure this species'
existence and stop it from going extinct. These efforts include breeding programs and the creation of protected areas. The tamaraw has a cultural and ecological significance
for the region and is regarded as a national symbol of the Philippines.

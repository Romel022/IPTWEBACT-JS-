     <p style = "font-size: 25px; margin-left: px;"> <b> Description: </b> <br> The Visayan leopard cat, or Prionailurus javanensis sumatranus in scientific jargon, is a diminutive wild cat subspecies found in the Visayan Island of the Philippines.
Its name refers to the leopard-like features of this elusive and nimble feline, including the characteristic spots and rosettes on its coat. 
Due to their nocturnal habits and reputation for seclusion and secrecy, Visayan leopard cats are mostly nocturnal animals. They are adept hunters
who target small mammals, birds, and reptiles for their prey. They thrive in dense woodlands and grasslands thanks to their small size, slender build,
and acute senses. 
The Visayan leopard cat is regarded as one of the most vulnerable animals because of habitat loss and hunting. Through Cconservation efforts, the natural
environment, preventing illegal poaching, and the continued existence of this rare and imperiled wild cat subspecies in the Philippines are all protected.

     <p style = "font-size: 25px; margin-left: px;"> <b> Description: </b> <br> The Crocodylus mindorensis, or Philippine crocodile, is a critically endagered species of crocodile that is native to the Philippines. It is one of the mostly
critically endagered crocodile species in the world and stands out for being smaller that other crocodile species, with adults typically reaching
lengths of 2 to 3 meters. In the Philippines, river, marshes, and lakes are among the freshwater habitats where these crocodiles can be found.
They have a V-shaped ridge between their eyes and a large nose. The Philippine crocodile's coloring can range from grayish-green to brown. 
The survival of this species has been seriously threatened, mostly as a result of illicit fishing and hunting, and habitat loss. To save this severly -
endagered species and a unique biodiversity of the Philippines, conservation initiatives, such as captive breeding programs and habitat protections are essential and in place.

     <p style = "font-size: 25px; margin-left: px;"> <b> Description: </b> <br> One of the tiniest ungulates in the world, the Philippine mouse-deer, Tragulus nigricans in Scientific jargon, is a specie indigenous to the Philippines.
These tiny deer are distinguished by their small stature, shy, private, and solitary habits. The reddish-brown coat of the Philippine mouse-deer is one of its distinguishing features,
along with its unusual white spots on its throat and bottom. They also feature long, flexible snouts, and tiny hooves, and skinny legs. They are good jumpers and agile enough to avoid
predators despite their small size. These creatures primarily consumes leaves, shoots, and fruits because they are herbivores. 
The Philippine mouse-deer is a vulnerable species because it is being hunted and its habitat is being lost. To preserve their habitats and guarantee the future of this unusual and
lovable species in the Philippines, conservation measures are currently under progress.

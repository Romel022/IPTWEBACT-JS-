     to the Philippines that is in grave risk  of extinction. It is regarded as one of the biggest and 
     most powerful eagles in the world and is also known as the "monkey-eating eagle." t has a strikingly long, 
     shaggy crest, which contributes to its majestic appearance, and bright blue eyes.  This eagle,  which can
     have a wingspan of up to 7 feet,is mostly found in the Philippines' rainforests, particularly 
     on the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Despite serving as the Philippines' national emblem, 
     the Philippine Eagle is threatened on a number of fronts, including habitat loss, deforestation, hunting, 
     and illegal trade, earning it a critical ranking on the IUCN Red List. <br>

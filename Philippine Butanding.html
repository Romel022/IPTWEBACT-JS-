filter-feeding habits, and unusual looks. Warm, tropical waters, coral reefs and coastal areas are the frequent habitat for these gentle giants. 
Its large, flattened head and mouth, which can be up to several feet wide, are among its distinguishing characteristics, as it the checkerboard-like pattern of spots and
stripes on its back. Whale sharks are filter feeders, primarily ingesting planktons, small fish, and other microscopic creatures by swimming with their mouths open, which is -
unusual for its gigantic size. Due to their well-known calm demeanor, whale sharks are a popular subject for ecotourism and diving activities, where participants can swim alongside
these majestic giants.
Whale sharks are also classified as vulnerable species despite having a wide distribution, mostly because of habitat deterioration, unintentional bycatch in fishing activities, and
poaching. To safeguard and maintain these extraordinary and majestic species, conservation efforts are in place.
